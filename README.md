# 🎯 University Dart Crash Course

This is my first time learning **Dart** 🚀

I’m taking this crash course outside the university because Dart is a **required subject** in my academic curriculum.  
The goal of this repository is to document my journey and keep everything organized in one place.

## 📚 Why This Repository?

- To understand how Dart works from scratch
- To practice syntax and core concepts
- To build small exercises and examples
- To use this repo as a personal reference in the future

## 🛠 First Challenge: Installing Dart

Since I had never used Dart before, I didn’t know how to run it on my machine.  
So I searched and learned the correct setup process:

1. Install the **Dart extension** on VS Code
2. Download and install the **Dart SDK**
3. Open my Dart project in VS Code
4. Add the SDK path inside the project settings (if needed)
5. Add the Dart SDK location and the `dart/bin` folder to the system **Environment Variables (PATH)**
6. Restart VS Code / Terminal to make sure everything works

After configuring the PATH correctly, the Dart command started working successfully in the terminal 🎉

## 🚀 Purpose

Mistakes will happen. Progress will come.
